32595510.0,"SDATA_9 :  You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.

There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being ``easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better``, the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons.

You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English ``oppressive influence`` on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don't we all gang up on you Francophobes together?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You keep the French out because of this Hanoverian fringe who says the English are Germans.  He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark's old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Please, let historical precedent decide who is a part of the English people vs who is only in governmental or political relation/alliance as a result of religious divisions and Parliamentary dictation of Royal affairs ever since the time of colonialism and especially 1603.  Henry VIII of England neither liked Martin Luther and his Prussian/Hanseatic culture, nor was Anne of Cleves going to provide an heirby choice of a King desparate for heirs.  That was the sentiment of the people, whom if Protestant had some Calvinist/French (Huguenot, Puritan) leanings to the exclusion of others.  Wesley's Hanoverian entrance to our religious climate had as much ``imported spirituality``, from the Moravians obviously not being part of English dispositioneven if Wyclif and Jan Hus seemed to get along for the sole purpose of dissent, they were false friends and allied by circumstance of a mutual ``enemy``.

Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category ``Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)`` [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a ``specialist`` would understand what type of saddle a ``kura`` was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category ``Saddles by type`` and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a ``Kura`` was, with the word ``Japanese`` added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a ``Kura`` was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.NEWLINE_TOKEN**I have seen ``precision`` mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled ``Precision and disambiguation``, WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article ``Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle?

558625092.0,"SDATA_9 :  `I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement ``probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles``. I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being ``bastardized`` as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate ``sourced`` information. There is substantial ``factually accurate`` sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an ``opposing view``. There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were ``out-documented`` by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_9",dev,0

Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki, and how someone don't want i do it:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Aeritalia G.91, also known as the Fiat G.91 and nicknamed Gina, was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s. It was eventually only adopted by three - the Italian Air Force, West Germany's Luftwaffe, and the Portuguese Air Force, but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Development==NEWLINE_TOKENIn 1953, European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter (LWSF) role. The G.91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the ``G`` designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe technical requirements were: NEWLINE_TOKEN* 1,100 m take-off distance over a 15 m obstacleNEWLINE_TOKEN* Capability to operate from grass strips and streetsNEWLINE_TOKEN* Max speed of 0.95 MachNEWLINE_TOKEN* Range of 280 km with 10 min over the targetNEWLINE_TOKEN* Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanksNEWLINE_TOKEN* 4x12.7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm gunsNEWLINE_TOKEN* A maximum of 2,200 kg empty weight and 4,700 kg max weightFerrari 1992, p. 83.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request.NEWLINE_TOKENThe projecting work was only apparently an easy task, because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFiat Aviazione presented G.91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects, analysed since 18 March by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development), led by Theodore Von Karman. The finalists were declared Breguet Taon, Dassault Etendard, Fiat G.91 and Folland Gnat. Another interesting project was Sud Aviation Badoleur, that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage, simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid (aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer). This, however, was not ufficially presented to AGARD, that choose, on paper, the Taon as winner.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the meanwhile, there was the problem of the engine, that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable, with easy and cheap maintenance, like the whole aircraft. The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus, a simple and effective turbojet. It was adopted to all the finalists, so Bristol will won the contest in every case. G.91R, presented by Fiat, was also called 'little Sabre'. It was due by the knowledge gained with license-production of a modern aircraft, the F-86K, that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts, . It was similar to F-86 as overall design, but smaller and capable to operate from semi-prepared airstrips.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG.91R was 20% heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware, but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B.Or 801, 1,800 kg/t.

393091989.0,"SDATA_9 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==The Signature of the Atomic Bomb=NEWLINE_TOKENThere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.     : EDATA_9",dev,0

As far as ``citing my sources``, I am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article, not making additions to the article.

I am not trying to say that what you're saying is not true at all. I'm sure it is true the the extent that it is. But how much is that?

You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citationNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: ``Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.`` Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are articles for ``Criticisms of Islam`` where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate ``criticisms of Islam`` articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGood day.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where ``treason`` or ``traitor`` is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.

Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of . He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN*While your first version was needlessly verbose (``it is to be noted that``), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the ``siege and demise``, e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict.

Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENBut Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) NEWLINE_TOKEN This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) NEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, it's more than a content issue.

Drmies (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENFact is, unless admins enforce it, don't count on it. Otherwise I wouldn't have had to come here.

If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV.

The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENI would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENOur IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same.

But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were ``guerillas``.  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  ``Guerilla`` was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem.`  : EDATA_9",dev,0

That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; ``the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.``  I went on to state that ``In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English`` (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.

So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; ``to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to ``refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language`` does not make this practice Afrocentric.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo User:DESiegelNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the ``N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word ``ebony`` in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  ``if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?``  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

403172857.0,"SDATA_9 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Non-Authority Professor Samuel Eliot Morison ==NEWLINE_TOKENTo some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery. How could a foreign chartmaker [NOTE: suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same ``LANERIO DE JANUA`` wool weaver of Genoa presented in the Raccolta document XXXXI from 1472, Morison, going against the documents promoted the wool-weaver to a chartmaker? ] of low birth who had been literally “on the beach” a few years before, marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom? Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s roving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry. ( Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Little, Brown, Boston, 1942).)NEWLINE_TOKENTHIS previous extract IS A FANTASY INVENTED By MORISON AND A BIG LIE- This is a fabrication by Morison written completely without any proof. Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa's dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Santos belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a ``Comendadora`` just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II's Mistress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nanny of King John II's aunts) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints ``Comendary``. Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa's marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother's noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station.(1) There is NO DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón.NEWLINE_TOKENThe motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the ``myth of the Genoese weaver`` and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer..... Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: ``Falsely calling him a craftsman ... [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences ... especially the four main sciences ... Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation ... The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts.(2) Today's investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.``NEWLINE_TOKEN (1) -«D.

94516168.0,"SDATA_9 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Evolution Article==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello Slrubinstein, I was a witness to the vast changes in the evolution article. Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also?

Essentially LTI theory developed to describe what Fourier/Laplace transforms and LCR circuits and can do. So it's surprising to an EE that a fundamental passive element would not work in that theory. But it's not important to a non EE.

The races should be mentioned in the bios, because race is biographical information. Other than that, unless there is good evidence that this was a racially motivated death (is there any evidence of such whatsoever?), it's simply not relevant. I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede.

I'm not putting WP:OR into an article, nor am I doing any. (Okay, I suppose calling it an urban legend was my own term and is WP:OR, but I was doing that conversationally and would never dream of putting it in the article). I simply said that this fact, if included, had to have a WP:RS. I have presented about a dozen or so sources, none of which include this. You have found one source, which is far less reliable than any of the ones I have brought, which mentions it as something rarely done today. I'm simply asking that this fact be sourced properly and that that be reflected in the article - something which you seem to be open to as well. If we use the BBC source, then we should probably also mention that none of the three major rabbinic organizations include this rule. (Citing their rules which I included links to in my previous comment). To clarify I'm not suggesting we use use the phrase ``urban legend`` in the article at all - I'm just saying that we need a better source than the original one and that the scope of the source be reflected.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Frankly I understand your somewhat visceral reaction. This idea is so pervasive that it has almost become a reality in and of itself in that perception frequently affects reality. I was taught that it was true, and took it as fact until recently when I had a conversation with a rabbi who does conversions for the RCA and helped draft their policies. Only afterwards did I start digging and realized it had no source. It is impossible to prove a negative so I can't prove to you that it doesn't exist ``somewhere``. However I can insist that we use a WP:RS. If you can find a reliable Jewish source, either classical or contemporary, for this then by all means include it with that source, but so far none has been located.

170650641.0,"SDATA_9 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Well first I am going to address some basic stuff that will help you ion the future.  Whenever you want to add a new topic to someones talk page, either click on the ``+`` at the top of the page, and then fill in the header, or you can just add == (your header) == after clicking ``edit this page,`` and then type your what you want under the header.  This creates the header that you see, which helps to keep convos organized, and after the 3rd or 4th header, your page will automatically have a table of contents, which helps for organization.  Secondly, and most importantly, whenever you add info to a talk page, always sign under your statement  by either typing ~~~~ or by clicking the little signature button in the edit toolbar, this generates your signature and a timestamp which links to your user page.  Now to address your concerns about the info into the article.  The main thing here on Wikipedia is that we cannot have original research which means that information cannot be added unless there is a respectable source to back it up, such as a website, news article, etc.  Just because someone read it somewhere or saw it on TV, doesn't mean it can or should be added to this encyclopedia.  Also Wikipedia is trying to clean up its trivia sections, because for the most part this type of information is not notable enough and it tends to be random.  These trivia sections also tend to be just lists of random information, which Wikipedia is not.  I would recommend that you just let it go, as more than likely, in some time (hopefully sooner than later) all this trivia information will be removed or added into the articles.  I hope you keep on editing though and try to make sure that you stay away from trivia, and to always source your edits.  Thanks!NEWLINE_TOKEN:  ♦  `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

26335756.0,"SDATA_9 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.`` Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMuslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2  : EDATA_9",dev,0

NSW seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established, so a slight change to current wording should suffice.  The second and third bullets are less clear.  Why does it matter that the data is a few years old, especially since the dates of the studies are clearly listed in the article?

Now Moses probably did exist  and probably did lead the Israelites to the land of Canaan (now Israel), but him parting the red sea and floating around in the river Nile are a bit hard to believe. The most likely situation is that these events were taken from Orphic myths around about 5 th century BCE, when  the Exodus story  was written.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRaksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.      : EDATA_9",dev,1

It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the ``new anti-Semitism.`` All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe.

409869164.0,"SDATA_9 :  Gnip is on the right track here, though I would like to suggest a few corrections to his last statement. The reason the book received so much negative feedback from academics was not only because of its high profile, but it certainly did play a major role. Historians did definitely want to counter the widespread praise the book was receiving from journalists and other non-specialists, but it was also the book’s clear and obvious failings that drew a lot of attention from academics, who felt it was their responsibility to expose the book’s problematic research and unsubstantiated conclusions. Any work claiming to provide a comprehensive biography of one of the world's most famous (or infamous) leaders will get noticed, and will certainly be watched closely by academics specializing in China studies. As someone currently working within this very millieu, I can say that most specialists I know of have spoken to were at least aware of the book. Gnip is, however, correct that the published response to the book (such as the Benton volume, or the China Journal response) were unusual, as I have stated before in this article's discussion. I think this is the part that is getting lost on John Smith's, unfortunately. Though I may be splitting hairs rehashing Gnip's words, what I am trying to clarify is that people should not be under the impression that academics only noticed the book due it its huge publicity. It is not correct to say that without its ‘high profile’ “the academic world would [never have known] about such a book.” Professional historians deal daily with the “low profile”, often reviewing books that never become very popular or well-known (ie. they don't sell very well outside of academia). In fact, they frequently research and dissect works that few outside of a very small circle of individuals will ever read. In this sense, academics are very insulated in what they do, and are often disconnected from the general public. That is not to say, however, that they are unaware of new publications outside of academia, particularly those re-evaluating major figures in history. Also, Benton’s volume “Was Mao Really a Monster” was not, in my opinion, a major contributor to the book’s popularity, as Gnip suggests. As you know, MTUS was first published in 2005, and this collection of reviews was only published in 2009, quite some time after the book had already become popular (and as you know, the reviews found in the volume had been previously published elsewhere). What is important about this recent volume is not how it contributed to the book’s popularity, in my opinion, but rather as a reflection of how distressed the academic community truly is by the MTUS’s continued popularity. This last fact is what I am concerned does not quite get across in the article, as it stands. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to appropriately correct that issue. I think that is what Midnightblueowl has been trying to address, and what I myself tried to do some time ago.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_9",dev,0

I don't know if that even applies to everyone or just to the editors under the ban, but I don't really care to be honest... this is out of hand. It's absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two ``sides`` against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:NEWLINE_TOKEN*I know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1's part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn't do anything about it, so I guess you didn't consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I'm not the admin. NEWLINE_TOKEN*Anyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn't change her behaviour, as here we are once again.NEWLINE_TOKEN*I'm truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few ``new`` users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don't like it. I don't think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn't rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.NEWLINE_TOKEN*I was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I've even lost my motivation to do that. I just don't care; it's a waste of time and probably won't get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.   `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

The only thing which needs to be discussed here is whether or not it's an appropriate and supportable addition.  A large part of the reason adding a link to this article is such a bone of contention in the Caylee Anthony article is because editors there appear to have difficulty separating how they feel from what is objectively supportable.  (2) No ``back door`` is necessary.  It is a perfectly acceptable addition to the Caylee Anthony article, and would not even be slightly controversial if the subject was not obscured by emotional hysterics.  (3) A reliable source is not required for something to be added to the ``See Also`` section.  No claim is being made except that the article being referenced in the See Also appendix has some relationship with the article and may be of interest to those interested in the article.  This point has been repeatedly stated and restated in discussion on the Caylee Anthony discussion page.  (4) By posting here you are making discussion even more difficult than it already is.

Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.NEWLINE_TOKEN:As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no ``freebie`` section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)NEWLINE_TOKEN:Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in.

29068682.0,"SDATA_9 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``  The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia's cons use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939.

But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting ``immigrants``. They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of ``God`` and ``son`` means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be ``friends``??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like ``The Beatles``! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: ``You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you.`` This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to ``area of rest``- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize ``Don't sweat the small stuff``. Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

I think that would cover things well and address the fact that Henderson and NLV are not quite as ``Las Vegas`` as the strip.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENToday there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTake for instance, the first paragraph after the header ``Technical description``...the paragraph ends with the sentence ``the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task.`` That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBasically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act.

So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the ``control`` of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent.

Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be ``George McCoy``, Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's ``Why Did He Do IT`` on his website (this is the author of ``A Sniper In The Tower``, who claimed the tower tragedy was the ``Worst Mass Murder In American History``, which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution.

The article makes no mention whatsoever of something that has really been puzzling me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy do I think that Racheal and Pris might be one and the same:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Pris originally introduces herself as Racheal Rosen when meeting JR Isidore and then changes her mind and calls herself Pris (if Pris is simply using her name for cover how do she know her?)NEWLINE_TOKEN- Deckard says that Racheal and Pris have the same eyes (in fact the only difference he notes are clothes)NEWLINE_TOKEN- We hear no more from Racheal after Pris has been killed (I'm assuming there she killed the goat before she went over to the conapt building)NEWLINE_TOKEN- When Pris runs towards Deckard before she dies her last words are along the lines of ``For all we meant to each other.``  Surely they don't know each other at all; Pris and Deckard have never met if she is someone else.NEWLINE_TOKEN-  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it - i.e. she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the AndysNEWLINE_TOKEN- Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android, it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model.  It is only when she offers to kill it herself that she calms down.  But then she would - she had just claimed to kill herself (i.e. bluff Pris' death or possibly commit suicide).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdmittedly there's a couple of snags.  If she is Racheal then she is working for the Rosen corporation, so why is she hiding with the runaways?  Unless she ``ran away`` from the corporation after Deckard originally tested her.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway I'd like to add something to the article - obviously nothing conclusive, but just acknowledge the possibility.

First: just because some Bulgarian editors may be misinterpreting or abusing the category system, why should we? Second: what if every article were subjected to your line of thinking? For instance, what if someone decided that Category:Communes in Cluj County was too inaccessible a place for Apahida, and decided to add in Category:Geography of Romania, and then someone did the same for Iclod, and pretty soon, that category ended up with ~3000 entries? Well, for one, it would become pretty useless, don't you think?

Adding is far less likely to step on toes than subtracting. Other editors will judge the quality of your work and you'll gain acceptance as one of the team. Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks.

She was small, slight, feeble, and a child in years; but with whitened face, and flashing eyes, she seized the dog by the back of the neck and dragged it down stairs; on reaching the hall, she let go her hold, and instantly the furious creature flew at her throat, but promptly, with her little clenched fist, she struck it in the eye and knocked it back; a quick succession of blows followed — every one of them being directed against the one or the other eye. The battery lasted for several minutes, when the animal fell down stupified, blinded, and senseless; and Emily dragged off its huge carcase in triumph, to foment the swollen eyes. The dog loved her, with a dog's lasting, slavish love, ever afterwards lived obedient to her call, and when she died mourned as weakly as a human creature over her grave.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Source: John Cordy Jeaffreson, Novels and novelists: from Elizabeth to Victoria (p. 292), published in 1858.  : EDATA_9",dev,0

With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be  : EDATA_9",dev,0

Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.  : EDATA_9",dev,0

BMK and APK are just that, in the style of editing that each chooses to use. Both are keen on the rules, as long as the rule at that moment applies to them, I.E. Be Bold allows BMK to change any photo he wants and allows him, to craft in moments a consensus, with his posse behind him. What I found amusing about that user is his ref to WP:DIVA, yet when you read DIVA, it really should a lot like how he handles himself here. His POV is the ONLY POV that matters and his passive aggressive POV pushing, dominates the topics he edits, and the user refuses to obtain unbiased comments from others as was noted in this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJersey_City%2C_New_Jersey&diff;=641043036&oldid;=641042701 Beyond My Ken, pretends to want others to offer insight as long as he can posture his POV by dissuading from voting on anything I contribute, and talking himself into thinking that other support his POV, 5 minutes later then just executing the edit. That is not a consensus, that is a dictator and abusive way to control and dominate anything he decides to Dominate. Epicgenius, NeilN, Castncoot, are followers for the most part. I think it is really funny that Epicgenius was the one that selected the Manhattan photo for the lead on that page, then goes back and tells me ``do not replace lead photos anymore``, but I guess it is still ok for them to do so, without any substantiation of the contributions. I do not think that ``Epicgenius`` knows what he is doing here yet, and his talk page somewhat supports that assertion. Castncoot like a picture of a bridge for the lead photo of a city, as that bridge is ``Iconic`` in spite of the fact that icons are not cities, my contribution was to create a page that was about the topic city, not leading with the bridge that gets you there. The photo I changed out was actually the real city, not the bridge going to it. After over 5 years, I have had only a few run ins with other editors. I have hundreds of lead photos and a number of Featured ones too. I have been bold in my editing, as BMK claims that allows him to dominate topics, and 99% of my photos are NEVER removed or replaced until someone decides to go off the deep end, as BMK and APK did here. lastly aerial photography is highly valued and extremely difficult, as the collective combination of skills required is overwhelming at times. No other editor on this site has contributed the type of content that I used to submit. Now that BMK has made it clear that he will stalk my edits and revert any photographic contribution I make, what is the point of continuing other then to just edit stories here, as I have for years and perhaps Wikipedia can one day find another aerial photographer that is willing to donate to the site. We will see.     `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb.

145694853.0,"SDATA_9 :  `   (not signed)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe widely used and agreed format is that for any organization listing particularly notable alumni, members, ect. in the article is OK; however, simply listing people for the sake of listing them dosen't add any meaningful content to the article as, unless the person is notable, then why would anyone else care about it.  Wikipedia is not a directly for simply listing information.  ``Notable`` is quite universally agreed to mean that the individual is important enough to have their own entry in Wikipedia.  So if the person isn't important enough to independently warrant their own biographical page then it's simply irrelevent to list their name in the article as having once been associated with an organization.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn regards to the above comment attempting to establish 'notability': Being mentioned in a local student run newspaper hardly counts, in its own right, as credible evidence for establishing that someone is notable enough for the rest of the world to know, or even care, who they are.  There is some precedent for establishing a chronological 'list' catagory, separate from the article itself, for long established offices or other leadership positions when that list would contain a number of notable indivduals (see above) with links to their biograpical articiles.  In such cases, there isn't much harm in filling in the list with 'non-notable' individuals for the sake of continuity.  However, in this case as this is still a very new organization and none of the names are, yet, notable it dosen't really make much sense nor does it add any meaningful content.  Perhaps is 30 years when, potentially, some former Berry leaders have gone on to notable careers such a list would be justified, but at the moment it would essentially just consitute pointless self promotion (citing the above previous concerns that this article appears to have been mostly written by those directly associated with the topic of the article).

They were psychiatric patients. That's why they excluded for consideration 46 of the 50 studies on anxiety that they found. They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: ``Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase.`` Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM. Cochrane looked at a single study on TM.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Eppley looked at every study on TM that related to anxiety. Most of these were nonclinical studies, that is, they included subjects that hadn't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. These studies, both meditation and relaxation, most commonly used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standardized assessment of anxiety levels that's been validated in hundreds of studies, to assess the level of anxiety in the subjects. His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM. In sum, the best way to represent these sources is to make it clear that they were looking at different populations of subjects, and hence, different groups of studies.   `  : EDATA_9",dev,1

The results suggest not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe team, led by James Morison of the University of Washington's Polar Science Center Applied Physics Laboratory, Seattle, used data from an Earth-observing satellite and from deep-sea pressure gauges to monitor Arctic Ocean circulation from 2002 to 2006. They measured changes in the weight of columns of Arctic Ocean water, from the surface to the ocean bottom. That weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean's surface, and its salinity. A saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe very precise deep-sea gauges were developed with help from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the satellite is NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace). The team of scientists found a 10-millibar decrease in water pressure at the bottom of the ocean at the North Pole between 2002 and 2006, equal to removing the weight of 10 centimeters (four inches) of water from the ocean. The distribution and size of the decrease suggest that Arctic Ocean circulation changed from the counterclockwise pattern it exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern that was dominant prior to 1990.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReporting in Geophysical Research Letters, the authors attribute the reversal to a weakened Arctic Oscillation, a major atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere. The weakening reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the North Pole, decreasing its weight and changing its circulation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Our study confirms many changes seen in upper Arctic Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, rather than trends caused by global warming,`` said Morison.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``While some 1990s climate trends, such as declines in Arctic sea ice extent, have continued, these results suggest at least for the 'wet' part of the Arctic  the Arctic Ocean  circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s,`` he added.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Arctic Oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970, but then varied on more or less decadal time scales, with signs of an underlying upward trend, until the late 1990s, when it again stabilized. During its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s, the Arctic environment changed markedly, with the upper Arctic Ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century. Many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift, raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the Arctic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMorison said data gathered by Grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short-lived the ocean circulation changes can be. The newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level. ``The winter of 2006-2007 was another high Arctic Oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum,`` he said. ``It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMorison cautioned that while the recent decadal-scale changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming, most climate models predict the Arctic Oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future. ``The events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the Arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world,`` he said.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGrace monitors tiny month-to-month changes in Earth's gravity field caused primarily by the movement of water in Earth's land, ocean, ice and atmosphere reservoirs. As such it can infer changes in the weight of columns of ocean water. In contrast, the pressure gauges installed on the sea floor in 2005-2006 directly measured water pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Gauge data were remotely recovered during the first year of the study.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The close agreement between the North Pole pressure gauges and Grace data demonstrates Grace's potential for tracking world ocean circulation,`` said study co-author John Wahr of the University of Colorado, Boulder.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Satellite altimeters, such as NASA's Jason, are ideal for studying ocean circulation but can't be used at Earth's poles due to ice cover,`` said study co-author Ron Kwok of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. ``Our results show Grace can be a powerful tool for trac  : EDATA_9",dev,0

The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the ``Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck``. I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be ``suburban``, part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages.

I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the ``process`` of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims.NEWLINE_TOKEN1. I sometimes find a ``You have a message waiting`` notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here?NEWLINE_TOKEN2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ``teaser`` articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441NEWLINE_TOKENWe have never been EB ``trial`` members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?NEWLINE_TOKEN3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use ``dummy`` accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, ``Oh yeah? Well, prove it!```` I have no idea what sort of ``proof`` one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might ``prove it.`` If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.NEWLINE_TOKEN4. As for ``my article,`` I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.NEWLINE_TOKEN5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ``new posting`` info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.NEWLINE_TOKEN6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ``credit`` for our efforts.

While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the ``imperial crown`` - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

I invite comment on whether ``Myth of 'Flat Earth' belief`` would be a better title.  ~   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Russell calls it the “modern Flat Earth Error” or just the “Flat Error” in Inventing the Flat Earth (1991). In a 1997 conference he then refers to it as “the myth of the flat earth” (no capitals anywhere). None of these variants convey what the actual error is, and of course the reason Russell doesn’t try is that a literally accurate name would be quite long, something along the lines of “the modern misconception of a medieval European belief in a flat earth”. “Myth of a 'Flat Earth' belief” isn’t horrible, but it’s still not likely to mean anything to someone who doesn’t already know what it’s supposed to mean, in which case we haven’t achieved anything by changing. Russell’s book title works better than any of these other attempts. Something along the lines of “Flat Earth concoction” would give less chance for someone to mistake the article as a description of the belief that the earth is flat, something that has already happened twice in just the call for a capitalization change.   NEWLINE_TOKEN* Comment: We don't care if Russell likes to overcapitalize in ways that MOS:CAPS doesn't sanction (and the source cited above suggests that there's a ``myth of Russell's capitalization`` at work here. Heh.) WP has a convention of not capitalizing such labels, even for universally accepted theories.  ``Modern flat earth error`` is a good start toward settling on a WP article title that makes sense. This article is about a modern belief about pre-modern belief in a flat earth. How do we address that most clearly? Two previously mentioned possibilities were ``Modern misconception of prevailing Middle Ages' belief in a flat Earth`` (which has a possessive usage error), and ``Modern misconception of prevailing belief in a flat Earth in history``.

In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.NEWLINE_TOKENb. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.NEWLINE_TOKENc. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (``I will make a suitable partner for man``) while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said ``Let US create man...``NEWLINE_TOKENd. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man ``out of the (clay of the) ground``.NEWLINE_TOKENe. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase ``God saw (his creation) that it was good`` while on the second narrative, the Lord God said ``IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone`` considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.NEWLINE_TOKENe. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== IRREGULARITIES ==NEWLINE_TOKENa. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?NEWLINE_TOKENb. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) ``LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden``. Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being ``East of Eden``.NEWLINE_TOKENc. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated ``the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth``. Question: when was rain created?NEWLINE_TOKENd. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?`` Huhhh?NEWLINE_TOKENe.

They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975.

If it's real, he's not here to build an encylopedia, he's here to experiment with the patience of its community in a way that essentially ignores its rules while purporting to test them.  If it's not, it's a post-hoc rationalization (or blatant lie) that attempts to justify how his contributions have been disruptive.  Playing coy, refusing to actually share it or disclose the details of the report, the 'experiment', the methodology, the contents of 'phase II', his co-experimentors, etc. further renders it an invalid effort to criticize wikipedia, making it rather useless to talk about if it can't be used to improve the project.  But that's my opinion and a long discussion.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I must apologize for not providing diffs here after your explicit request, but I really think the best thing to do is to review whole talk page sections - I don't see the advantage to posting multiple diffs when a whole section does the same thing in one fell swoop.  Content-wise, I think these two sections are the best to illustrate a critical feature - ME and CFS are considered the same diagnosis by the majority of the medical community, and there's minimal support for separating the two.  Talk:Chronic fatigue syndrome#ME or CFS contains references that explicitly state the two are the same.  Talk:Chronic fatigue syndrome#ME as a separate condition from CFS contains, from what I can gather, the best and most supportive sources to justify the two conditions being separate.  You can see my analysis and conclusions - I don't think it's sufficiently clear that the majority consider them separate.  From this point onwards, I would think a reasonable editor would conclude that the consensus is the conditions are separate, and edit accordingly (unless new evidence/sources came to light to revisit the issue).  In addition, the journal used was reviewed on RSN here and found wanting.  The keep-or-split discussion has been revisited many times - here, here and again here.  The same discussion, several times in one year, without any substantial new, medically reliable sources that clearly demonstrate there is sufficient support in the medical community for a separate diagnosis, has worn down the patience of many contributors; that it's been done with a fairly continuous level of dismissiveness of others' opinions, with countless insinuations that other contributors are either stupid, or haven't done their research, hasn't helped either, and then to find out it may all be part of some experiment that has nothing to do with actually writing an encyclopedia...

I just did some research on Rayleigh scattering in air; I added some content to Rayleigh scattering. The bottom line is that at atmospheric pressure, Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm is about 10^-5 per meter. A 1 mW green laser has a luminous power of 0.6 lumen, and hence rayleigh scattering is 6e-6 lumen per meter over a 2 mm beam (a 0.002 m2 surface). The beam will hence appear roughly as if it were illuminated at 6e-6/0.002 = 3 millilux, which is comparable to a moonless clear night sky. (I should actually correct the number to deal with the angular distribution).

That former worker told me that Humbard used ``scare tactics`` to get viewers, especially elderly viewers, to send in money.  The main ploy was to send out many mass mailings and claim that his program would go off the air unless the viewers sent in a lot of money.  The former computer center employee told me that Humbard told viewers in these mass mailings that ``the government`` was trying to shut him down.  Also, the former employee told me that the Canadian government was so concerned about the mailings and calls to elderly viewers in Canada that Humbard was banned from mailing any promotion materials to Canada. Humbard's computer system was state-of-the-art, as was his TV studio equipment.  An IBM engineer told me that Humbard had the newest and one of the best IBM mainframe computer systems in Ohio.  A former engineer at WJW TV 8 in Cleveland told me that Humbard had, at least for a few years, the most expensive and sophisticated television production equipment in the Cleveland area.

The concrete tower to support the restaurant was over 400 feet tall and the FAA was against the construction due to airline flight paths into Hopkins International airport.  Cuyahoga Falls is fairly close to the airport.

616529617.0,"SDATA_9 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.NEWLINE_TOKENOther Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.NEWLINE_TOKENThe San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said ``Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,`` a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.NEWLINE_TOKENAll of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENWhatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase ``Legend in his own mind``. Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.77.220.178 (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJust so you know - I am nowhere near San Diego, haven't been to the college EVER and am not using an alias.

Articles are open for editing during AFD, and people objected to the name. I improved the article by changing the name, which no one seemed to like. Obviously, one should then change the name of the AFD to correspond to the article. For you to call that disruptive demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the process.  If I had changed it to something silly, that would be different, but I doubt there's an editor here who disputes that was an improvement.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::Second, I did not attack Aaron in it, I described his actions. I factually said he did not do a, b, & c. I also described it as a preposterous attempt to circumvent standard procedure. It was. Honestly, I've been around for years, and I've never seen anything remotely like that nomination. Now, I don't think he's trying to make a point, I think he's dead serious and that's the scary thing.

Starting three or four weeks ago, an anonymous user, kept editing on Vaslui page, false information about the team. The media speculated many transfers, and this user edited them all as being sure transfers. This was for almost three weeks, when I just couldn't keep revert his edits anymore. So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page, and linked every sentence (because there was no reference before), and I applied for semi-protection for SC Vaslui page. After I got the page protected, there was no longer any false information, until  edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui (back then, he wasn't). I saw his contribs, and noticed that he is 13 years old, and is a big SC Vaslui fan, and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before. I don't think that's a coincidence.

Now that  has been hounded away from editing ``Murder of Meredith Kercher``, the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of ``colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia``. Perhaps if American student Amanda had been ``Adam Knox`` then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how ``Donald Trump`` rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, ``Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed`` (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on ``Amanda Knox`` and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:NEWLINE_TOKEN:* ``Amanda Knox`` (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* ``Raffaele Sollecito`` (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* ``Prosecution of Amanda Knox`` (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* ``Investigations of Kercher murder`` (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* ``Murder of Meredith Kercher`` (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.NEWLINE_TOKENI have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response.

I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::``The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names``  (i.e. not ``must`` be) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as ``Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place``... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNotice the words ``and should be used in articles with caution``. I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENI'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks in advance for all your help. `  : EDATA_9",dev,0

Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think two events are being conflated here.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSimultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  ) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Artillery ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne omission and one challenge. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French ``batteries`` (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).

Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.
